# Alzheimer-s
PSY6422 Mini Project Assignment
This project focuses on the global mortality rate of Alzheimer’s disease, alongside other forms of dementia. The raw dataset was accessed via Our World in Data (World Health Organization, 2025), derived from the original World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Global Health Estimates (GHE) of 2023 (World Health Organization, 2023).  

How does Alzheimer's disease mortality rate in the world's three most populated countries (India, China, United States of America) compare to the global average across the 2000–2021 period?
